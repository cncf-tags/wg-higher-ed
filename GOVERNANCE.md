## Motivations
Please see our [Charter](./CHARTER.md) for the motivations of this project.

## Maintainers

Higher-Ed Working Group Maintainers have write access to the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/cncf-tags/wg-higher-ed).
They can merge their own patches or patches from others.
The current maintainers are:

* Langdon White (@langdon), Boston University
* Catherine Paganini (@CathPag), Buoyant

Maintainers collectively manage the project's resources and contributors.
We normally call the roll of "maintainer" a "facilitator".

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers are people who care about the Higher Ed Working Group and want to help it grow and improve.
A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality content, and follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping the project succeed.

The collective team of all Maintainers is known as the Maintainer Council, which is the governing body for the project.

### Becoming a Maintainer

TBD

### Removing a Maintainer

TBD

## CNCF Resources

Any Maintainer may suggest a request for CNCF resources during a
meeting.
A simple majority of Maintainers approves the request.
The Maintainers may also choose to delegate working with the CNCF to non-Maintainer community members, who will then be added to the [CNCF's Maintainer List](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv) for that purpose.

## Voting

TBD

## Modifying the Charter

Changes to this Governance and its supporting documents may be approved by a 2/3 vote of the Maintainers.
