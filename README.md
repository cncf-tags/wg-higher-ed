# Higher Ed (Cloud Native Curriculum) Charter

## Who we are

Faculty-led, the Higher Ed Working Group seeks to create a collaborative global network of faculty to develop a cloud native curriculum that is open access.
Our goal is to level the playing field by giving faculty around the world, particularly in underrepresented communities, the tools they need to to teach their students cloud native skills and positioning them to compete on a global market for the most competitive jobs in the industry.
