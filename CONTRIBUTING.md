Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! ðŸ’–

Please file an issue (or a pull request!) if any of the content below doesn't make sense or if you find spelling/grammar errors.

## Ways to Contribute

* Identification and inclusion of prior art.
In other words, are you aware of or did you create content that is relevant to our goals?
Please add your item to [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T9C_bO5e-9dE4GSmuw1Z4suKMYu4XWDGAg8jR9bz3kM/edit) or [file an issue](https://github.com/cncf-tags/wg-higher-ed/issues/new?labels=prior-art) with the "Prior Art" tag.
* Choose an Educational Module to work on.
You can find a template for them and the current proposed list in the [Proposed Educational Modules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gpBb_tj7KxMGXeBcnpcH4vb5HQ3IuWT4dO7WD-e8eGs/edit#heading=h.udcxqcmc3rnb) document.
We are very interested in a better name for these so please also make suggestions if you have any :).

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Please come to our [meetings](#come-to-meetings) and let's discuss how we can work together.

### Come to Meetings

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings.
You never need an invite to join us.
In fact, we want you to join us, even if you donâ€™t have anything you feel like you want to contribute.
Just being there is enough!

You can find out more about our meetings [here](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/).
You donâ€™t have to turn on your video. The first time you come, introducing yourself is more than enough.
Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving feedback on othersâ€™ ideas, and even sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Slack Channel

Can't make the meetings but still want to be involved?
Please, join our slack channel (#higher-ed) on the [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/) and share your thoughts.

## Ask for Help

We are a very new group so there are probably lots of things that are unclear or missing from the content we have developed.
Please, please, let us know if you think information is missing or unclear.

The best way to communicate with us is via the [meetings](#come-to-meetings) or the Slack channel.

## Pull Requests

If you are interested in contributing to the project, please follow the guidelines below.
If you are new to GitHub or contributing to open source, please feel free to come to a [meeting](#come-to-meetings) or ask someone on our [slack channel](#slack-channel).

Generally speaking, any pull request (PR) is fine.
However, please follow the below guidelines to ensure the PR gets feedback on its content rather than mechanics.

### Sign Your Commits

#### DCO
Licensing is important to open source projects.
It provides some assurances that the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the author(s) desired.
We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to our project's repositories.
The [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) is a way to certify that you wrote and have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must match the git user and email associated with the commit.

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running

    git commit --amend -s
