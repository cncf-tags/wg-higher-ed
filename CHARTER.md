# Higher Ed (Cloud Native Curriculum) Charter

## Problem statement

Cloud native is developing fast, but textbooks take a long time to produce.
We also are seeing a proliferation of "tech-adjacent" students not just typical computer science majors who need exposure to the cloud native world.
At present, many students are expected to learn the space while "on the job."
Additionally, high-quality technology education is only available to a few students worldwide.
Smaller colleges, vocational schools, and those in underdeveloped countries often lack the internal know-how to prepare their students for the competitive tech market.

In a related way, many students have no exposure to the ethos and community of open source.
They may have used some open source applications but they are rarely exposed to what it means for an application to be "open source."
In addition, students need to be aware of all of the "open efforts" like open hardware, open data, open research, etc. whether they use them or not to help them understand that a community is often as important to good work as the work itself.

Without a widely accessible cloud native curriculum any teacher or professor can tap into, we perpetuate the status quo: only students with access to the best education or mentors who can guide them are exposed to the newest technologies and are more likely to have access to the highest-paying jobs in tech.

## Vision

A volunteer-based group, led by computer science professors and open source communities from universities worldwide supported by industry veterans, can help democratize cloud native education. While the main goal is to develop a cloud native curriculum (or curricula) accessible to any university, there are many more benefits.

This group will provide a platform for faculty and open source communities to exchange ideas and lessons learned, enabling them to become better teachers.
Creating a global network of professors will foster collaboration and more opportunities for students worldwide.
Injecting industry expertise will ensure that professors are teaching students the current industry practices.
Overall, cloud native education will improve, creating a new generation of highly qualified cloud native practitioners.
Centering this work in the CNCF ensures that the education can be vendor-neutral while still allowing vendors to adapt the curricula to their products.

## Mission

Empower faculty worldwide, particularly those that serve the most underrepresented, to provide independent, high-quality cloud native development education to their students, giving them the tools they need to compete for the highest-paying jobs in tech.

## Goal

Develop a cloud native curriculum that is open source, regularly updated, and accessible to faculty around the world.
